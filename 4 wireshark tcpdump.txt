. Wireshark Program (Graphical Tool)
Wireshark is a GUI-based tool. You don’t write a traditional "program" in code, but rather use it interactively. Here’s how to use it:

Steps:

1.Open Wireshark

2.Select the interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0)


3.Use filters like:


	1.ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 – Filter traffic for a specific IP
	2.tcp.port == 80 and ip.src == 192.168.1.2
Exporting Output:
You can save captured traffic to .pcap files

Go to File > Export > As CSV or similar formats

2. tcpdump Alternative for Windows

Windows doesn’t natively support tcpdump, but alternatives include:

Option A: Using WinDump (Windows port of tcpdump)
Installation:

Download WinDump: http://www.winpcap.org/windump/ (Note: WinPcap is required, but Npcap in “WinPcap compatibility mode” may work)

Install Npcap in compatibility mode for WinDump.

Usage (Command Prompt as Admin):


windump -D                    :: List interfaces
windump -i 1                  :: Capture on interface 1
windump -i 1 host 192.168.1.1 :: Capture packets to/from specific host
windump -i 1 -w output.pcap   :: Save output to file
